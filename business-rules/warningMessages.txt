10;if non-specific term is selected (describe);BR10> The use of non-specific terms is discouraged;NONE;LOW
11;if the generic facet Processed (or children) is selected;BR11> The use of generic terms is discouraged;LOW;LOW
12;if an ingredient is selected for raw commodity or derivative;BR12> Ingredient facet can only be used as minor ingredient for derivatives;LOW;LOW
13;if a source is selected for derivative with only one F27.;BR13> The source facet is allowed for derivatives with only one source commodity just for better specifying the raw source;LOW;LOW
14;under development;BR14> under development;HIGH;HIGH
15;if the user add an already existing implicit to the baseterm;BR15> The facet is already implicitly present in the baseterm. Please remove it;HIGH;HIGH
16;if a derivative is described with a process facet with an ordCode value less than the implicit ordCode;BR16> Reporting facets less detailed than the implicit facets is discouraged;HIGH;HIGH
17;if a facet is selected as baseterm is not valid;BR17> Reporting a facet as base term is forbidden;HIGH;HIGH

19;if a forbidden process is chosen (the derivative should be used);BR19> The reported processes cannot be applied to the raw commodity (use the existing derivative);HIGH;HIGH
20;if a deprecated term has been chosen;BR20> The selected term cannot be used since it is deprecated;HIGH;HIGH
21;(DEPRECATED)if a dismissed term has been chosen;BR21> The selected term cannot be used since has been dismissed;HIGH;HIGH
22;(ONLY CB) if a non-hierarchy is selected as base term (describe function);BR22> Base term successfully added;NONE;NONE
23;(ONLY CB) if more than one process with the same ordCode is chosen (mutually exclusive property violated);BR23> The selected processes cannot be used together;HIGH;HIGH
24;(ONLY CB) if a base term which does not belong to reporting or exposure hierarchy is selected;BR24> The term selected cannot be reported;LOW;LOW

27;(ONLY CB) if two processes (implicit or explicit) with decimal ordcode and same integer part are applied (at least one explicit);BR27> Use the existing derivative instead of adding the facet;HIGH;HIGH
28;(ONLY CB) if reconstitution is added as process to concentrate, powder or other dehydrated terms;BR28> Select the reconstituted version of the product instead;HIGH;HIGH
